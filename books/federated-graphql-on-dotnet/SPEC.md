Title: **Federated GraphQL on .NET**
Subtitle: *Building and running distributed graphs with HotChocolate and
WunderGraph Cosmo*
Author: Giang Dang

## Status

Scaffolded (structure only - no chapter content written). Next actions: draft
chapter 01 when asked; create the companion repo before chapter 02 drafting.

## Decision log

Settled 2026-08-08 through a three-round requirements interview. A settled row
is re-opened only by recording what changed and why, in the row.

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Purpose | Learn-by-writing deep dive, held to publication-grade rigor |
| 2 | Audience | Knows GraphQL basics, new to HotChocolate; Part I is the foundation |
| 3 | Spine | Apollo Federation v2 spec; subgraphs in HotChocolate (HotChocolate.ApolloFederation); composed, routed, and operated with WunderGraph Cosmo end to end |
| 4 | Versions | Written against current stable (HotChocolate 16.x); HotChocolate 14 differences live in appendix C, not the main text |
| 5 | Depth | Three altitudes: conceptual diagrams everywhere; source-guided walkthroughs selectively (pinned to version tags); wire-level always for federation mechanics |
| 6 | Alternatives | Fusion 16 deep with working code (ch 27); Apollo Router working-but-brief (ch 28); Hive, Grafbase, Mesh, stitching surveyed with a decision matrix; architectural alternatives to federation get ch 26 |
| 7 | Operations | Full dedicated part (VI); cloud-neutral, container-based |
| 8 | Running example | One threaded commerce system ("Mosaic"), monolith to federated across the book; isolated micro-examples for mechanisms |
| 9 | Venue | This latex-books pipeline (LuaLaTeX, latexmk, CI) |
| 10 | Length | 450-550 pages |
| 11 | Language | English |
| 12 | Voice | First-person practitioner; humanizer bar (library defaults in CLAUDE.md) |
| 13 | Postman | First-class: dev-loop intro in ch 02; subgraph-level `_entities` and `_service` testing in ch 07-08; consolidated workbook in ch 19; Postman CLI smoke tests in CI |
| 14 | Automated testing | Full chapter (ch 20) plus composition checks in the CI/CD chapter (ch 22) |
| 15 | Cosmo demos | Router-only composition first (ch 09-10, no account needed); full self-hosted platform in ch 21; Cosmo Cloud as a sidebar |
| 16 | Companion code | Separate repo F:/repo/mosaic-graph; .NET 10 LTS; docker-compose baseline; Aspire in ch 27 and appendix B; chapter-tagged; created when ch 02 drafting starts |
| 17 | Listings and diagrams | minted (-shell-escape enabled in .latexmkrc) for C# and GraphQL; TikZ-native diagrams |
| 18 | Chapter apparatus | End-of-chapter "Your turn" labs tied to repo tags; recurring "Under the hood" sections plus dedicated Part IV; index maintained while writing, not retrofitted |
| 19 | Title | "Federated GraphQL on .NET" with the subtitle above; versions stay out of the main title |
| 20 | Demo name | "Mosaic" - PROVISIONAL, freely renameable until the companion repo is created |

## Version baseline

Verified 2026-08-08; details and sources in
research/2026-08-federation-landscape.md. Re-verify before drafting chapters
that depend on them.

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| HotChocolate / HotChocolate.ApolloFederation | 16.6.0 (2026-08-05) |
| WunderGraph Cosmo (router, wgc CLI) | current as of Aug 2026 - pin exact versions when the companion repo is created |
| ChilliCream Fusion (ch 27) | 16.5 |
| Apollo Federation specification | v2.15 (LTS, Jul 2026) |
| .NET | 10 (LTS) |

## Table of contents

Approved 2026-08-08. If drafting deviates, update this list in the same
session. Chapter folders in chapters/ carry the same scope lines.

### Part I - One Service Done Right

1. **Why One Graph Is Never Enough** - single-schema failure modes, team coupling, where federation fits, the Mosaic storefront, first pass at "do you need this" (ch 26 in full)
2. **HotChocolate, Quickly** - first service on .NET 10; annotation-based vs code-first vs schema-first; Mosaic monolith v1; the Postman dev loop
3. **The Life of a Request** - parsing, validation, operation compilation, resolvers, middleware; first source-guided walk
4. **Data Without the N+1** - EF Core, DataLoader usage and batching internals, projections/filtering/sorting/pagination
5. **Schema Design That Survives Change** - abstract types, Relay conventions, error design, deprecation, single-service subscriptions

### Part II - Thinking in Entities

6. **The Federation Model** - supergraph/subgraphs, entity ownership, the Apollo Federation v2 directive tour, composition rules conceptually
7. **How a Federated Query Actually Runs** - query plans, representations, `_entities`/`_service`, exact router-subgraph HTTP traffic, captured in Postman
8. **The First Cut: Extracting Catalog** - HotChocolate.ApolloFederation, reference resolvers, extending foreign entities; testing a naked subgraph in Postman before any router exists
9. **Composition** - satisfiability, reading composition errors, `wgc router compose` (router-only), supergraph anatomy
10. **Enter the Router** - Cosmo Router locally: config, first federated query, reading query plans

### Part III - Decomposition in Practice

11. **Entity Resolution Done Right** - DataLoader-backed reference resolvers, representation batching internals, `@requires`/`@provides`, computed fields, boundary nullability
12. **Strangling the Monolith** - carving Orders/Inventory/Pricing/Accounts/Reviews, `@override` progressive migration, team contracts
13. **Hard Modeling Problems** - cross-subgraph pagination, abstract types across boundaries, shared enums/scalars, global ID design
14. **Real-Time in a Federated World** - subscriptions through the router, Cosmo EDFS with NATS/Kafka, `@defer`/`@stream` reality check
15. **Identity and Authorization Across the Graph** - JWT at router vs subgraph, claim forwarding, `@authorize`, `@authenticated`/`@requiresScopes`, public vs internal graphs

### Part IV - The Machinery

16. **Inside HotChocolate** - executor end to end: operation compiler, execution plans, middleware chains, resolver compilation, DataLoader scheduling (16.x source tags)
17. **Inside the Router and the Composer** - wgc composition (satisfiability algorithm), Cosmo normalization/planning/plan cache, entity fetch batching, Apollo Router planner contrast
18. **The Wire, Completely** - persisted operations/trusted documents, APQ, multipart `@defer` framing, graphql-ws vs SSE, compression, caching headers

### Part V - Confidence

19. **The Postman Federation Workbook** - collections, environments, JWT pre-request scripts, subscription testing, mock servers, Postman CLI in CI, Nitro sidebar
20. **Automated Tests That Catch Federation Bugs** - unit/integration/snapshot tests, reference-resolver tests, composition checks as tests, contract tests

### Part VI - Production

21. **The Platform: Self-Hosting Cosmo** - full stack via docker-compose, registry as source of truth, Cosmo Cloud sidebar
22. **CI/CD for a Federated Graph** - `wgc check` as PR gate, breaking-change detection, publish-on-deploy, router rollout, deprecation workflow
23. **Seeing Production: Observability** - OpenTelemetry across router and subgraphs, trace correlation, metrics, incident debugging
24. **Staying Up: Resilience and Performance** - partial failure semantics, nullability under failure, timeouts/retries/circuit breaking, caching, k6 load testing
25. **Locking Down: Security Hardening** - depth/complexity limits, introspection policy, persisted-operations-only, CORS, secrets, multi-tenancy

### Part VII - The Landscape and the Road Ahead

26. **Do You Actually Need Federation?** - modular monolith, BFFs, REST/gRPC aggregation, decision framework
27. **Fusion** - Fusion 16 hands-on: Composite Schemas spec, Nitro CLI/Aspire composition, wire protocol vs `_entities`, mixed graphs, Cosmo coexistence
28. **The Gateway Market and the Future** - Apollo Router hands-on plus licensing/GraphOS realities, Hive/Grafbase/Mesh/stitching survey, decision matrix, Composite Schemas trajectory

### Appendices

- A. **Toolchain Setup and the Mosaic Repo Tour**
- B. **Local Orchestration with .NET Aspire**
- C. **If You Are on HotChocolate 14** - mapping 14-era APIs and Fusion v1 to the current stack

## Writing rules (book-specific)

Library-wide defaults are in CLAUDE.md; these are this book's additions.

- Every hands-on chapter includes a "verify it in Postman" step.
- Internals claims are pinned: name the HotChocolate 16.x source tag or Cosmo
  release a walkthrough was checked against.
- Code listings come from the mosaic-graph companion repo once it exists;
  until then, write no listings that pretend to be real code.
- Each chapter ends with a "Your turn" lab referencing a companion-repo tag.
- Facts from research/2026-08-federation-landscape.md must be re-verified
  before drafting the chapters that use them (Parts VI and VII especially).

## Open items

- Companion repo F:/repo/mosaic-graph: create when chapter 02 drafting starts.
- Demo retailer name "Mosaic" is provisional; confirm or rename before the
  companion repo is created (rename is a find-and-replace until then).
- (resolved 2026-08-08) minted builds verified twice: locally on MiKTeX
  (minted v3 needs TEXMF_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, set in .latexmkrc) and in the one
  CI run that existed before CI was removed. Compile checks now happen in the
  repo's pre-commit hook.
- refs.bib still holds the template's knuth1984 placeholder; replace as real
  citations accrue (research file sources are candidates).
